                &emsp;&emsp;Star Wars, space opera film series (created by
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" target="_blank"
                >George Lucas</a
                >) that became one of the most successful and influential franchises
                in motion picture history. Begun in the 1970s and ’80s and
                resuscitated at the turn of the 21st century, the Star Wars films
                continually advanced the field of motion picture special effects and
                developed into an enormously lucrative merchandising industry.

                &emsp;&emsp;Lucas’s success as a writer and director with American
                Graffiti (1973) gained him the backing of

                , which put up $9.5 million for the production of the first Star
                Wars film. The film, directed by Lucas, was in production for four
                years, with scenes shot in
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia" target="_blank"
                >Tunisia</a

                , California, and on soundstages in England. When it was released on
                May 25, 1977,

                (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope) met with runaway
                success. A space opera set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far
                away,” the film centres on

                (played by the then relatively unknown Mark Hamill), a young man who
                finds himself embroiled in an interplanetary war between an
                authoritarian empire and rebel forces. <br />

                captivity on a massive space station commanded by the menacing Darth

                ) became instantly iconic. At the core of the film and the series it
                initiated are the Jedi Knights—a group of either benevolent or
                malevolent warriors who harness and manipulate the Force, an
                all-pervasive spiritual essence that holds in balance the forces of
                good and evil—and Skywalker’s quest to join their ranks.

                &emsp;&emsp;Though Star Wars initially opened in only 42 theatres,
                the film earned almost $3 million in its first week and had grossed
                $100 million by the end of the summer. The film won six Academy
                Awards along with a special-achievement award for accomplishments in
                sound, and it revolutionized the motion picture industry with its
                advancements in special effects. Lucas’s effects company, Industrial
                Light and Magic (ILM), designed a slew of imaginative alien
                creatures and mechanical “droids” that populated a variety of exotic
                locales. Perhaps most impressive, however, were the elaborate space
                battles accomplished with scaled miniatures.
                <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp;The series continued to make remarkable
                advancements in the field of special effects into the 21st century,
                and ILM became one of the most successful effects studios utilized
                by Hollywood. Lucas followed the first Star Wars film with two
                sequels,

                >
                (1983). The franchise thrived in the 1980s and ’90s through the
                release of videos, a substantial merchandise line, and the
                theatrical re-release of the trilogy in 1997.

                &emsp;&emsp;More than 20 years after the first film appeared, Lucas
                began releasing a second trilogy of films depicting events that had
                transpired before those in the original series. Lucas returned to
                the role of director (he had directed the first film but not its two
                sequels) and utilized a new cast of popular young actors—including
                Ewan McGregor and

                (2005) were all box-office successes, though they received markedly
                less critical acclaim than the original trilogy. <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp; The Star Wars franchise, however, remained incredibly
                lucrative into the 21st century. It included not only clothing,
                action figures, and multiple extensive book series but also the
                animated feature film
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars" target="_blank"

                (2008)—which depicted events occurring between Episode II and
                Episode III—and numerous successful video game lines created by
                another of Lucas’s companies, LucasArts. By the time the sixth film
                was released in 2005, nearly 30 years after the series began, it was
                estimated that the franchise as a whole had brought in some $20
                billion, an achievement thus far unparalleled in the motion picture
                industry. <br /><br />&emsp;&emsp; A seventh film,
                <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens"
                target="_blank"
                >Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens</a
                >
                , was released in 2015. It was the first entry in the series to be
                produced by the Walt Disney Company, which had purchased Lucasfilms
                Ltd. in 2012. The film, which was directed by J.J. Abrams,
                introduced new characters to the Star Wars mythos and expounded upon
                the stories of favourites such as Han Solo and Princess Leia.

                (2017), directed by Rian Johnson, carried on the saga with the
                reintroduction of Luke Skywalker. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker
                (2019; also called Star Wars: Episode IX—The Rise of Skywalker),
                with Abrams at the helm, was the final installment in the nine-film
                series that began with Star Wars. Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018)
                were installments in the series A Star Wars Story, which comprised
                stand-alone films.
